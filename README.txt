1. Open the Vivado project named 'lab3_pipelined_convolution'.
2. It has two modules: design module named 'top_pipelined_conv' and testbench module named 'pipelined_conv_tb'.
3. There is a python script named 'img_to_text' that converts image to text file. Run that to generate the file named 'pixel_values' corresponding to the image named 'image'. 
4. Then run the simulation to get the output of convolution. The output can be observed in the waveform with output variable named 'conv_out' as well as in a text fime named 'result_values'.
5. To see the output image, run the python script named 'text_to_image' that converts text to image file. Run that to generate the image named 'output' corresponding to the file named 'result_values'. 
6. The report showing LUT utilisation and the methodolody explaining the design of five-stage pipeline can be found here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1t5MGyj3LM1kTIA8urS9_PUWQ9B3xCcITYzbRPLm5YEg/edit?usp=sharing
